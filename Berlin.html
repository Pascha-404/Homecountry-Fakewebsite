    <h1><b> Berlin </b>– the city where anything is possible</h1>

    <h2>Berlin, the capital city of Germany, is renowned for its exceptional range of landmarks, vibrant cultural scene
        and way of life that's somehow all go yet relaxed.</h2>

    <P>In fact, the city is best known for its striking contrasts. Historical buildings stand alongside modern
        architecture as the past and present intermingle. The sights Berlin has to offer, from the Brandenburg Gate
        to the Chancellor's Office, bear witness to the history of an entire nation. Germany's capital is home to all
        the main government buildings, including the historical Reichstag building as the seat of the German parliament.
        Berlin is the city of art, artists and museums. In fact, precious artefacts from all over the world are
        showcased at more than 170 museums here, some of which can be found on the internationally renowned Museum
        Island.
        Berlin is a popular destination for classical music fans from every corner of the globe thanks to its leading
        orchestras, such as the globally popular Berlin Philharmonic, and the city's three huge opera houses,
        where spectacular operas and ballets are performed. And there is no end of theatre venues specialising in
        variety performances, revue, cabaret and more to ensure that there is something to keep everyone entertained.
        Shopaholics are in their element on the renowned Kurfürstendamm, on the elegant Friedrichstraße and in the
        independent boutiques around the Hackesche Höfe. Berlin is a trendsetting city when it comes to music, art and
        life itself.
        More and more artists are flocking to Berlin from all around the world to draw inspiration from the endless
        creative vibes, making it one of the most exciting destinations in the whole of Europe. The vibrant city is
        abuzz with
        change – Berlin simply cannot stay still for a moment. And yet the city somehow remains chilled, with plenty of
        open spaces where people can go to breathe in some fresh air. With sprawling parks, wooded areas and lakes,
        Berlin
        is Germany's greenest city. During the summer months, everyone moves outside. The sunshine and balmy evenings
        are best enjoyed in the beach bars, cafés and open-air cinemas and theatres, after all.</P>



    <h2>Nightlife districts in Berlin</h2>

    <p>While Berlin is exciting during the day, some districts only reveal their full beauty once the evening begins.
        When life plays out on the streets and the restaurants, bars and pubs begin to fill up.
        When Berliners and guests from all around the world meet up. When the evening never ends and night becomes day.
        Then you’ll experience a whole other side of the city and will truly have arrived in Berlin.</p>

    <p>Berlin loves techno – and that’s why it’s only in Berlin where you can realise how varied and electrifying this
        music can be. With Berghain and Watergate you have the choice between two of the best clubs
        in the world, guaranteed. You don’t have to worry about closing times, which is something quite contrary to
        other European cities. And even the public transport service has been designed with the lively
        party scene in mind: on the weekend most trains and buses will transport you to the most happening districts
        around the clock.
    </p>

    <p>There are no restraints placed on your party mood. Whether iconic Berlin, fashionable, alternative or vibrantly
        electronic: You’ll find the perfect way to spend the evening in each neighbourhood.</p>
