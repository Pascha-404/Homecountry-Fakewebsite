            <h1><b> Berlin </b>– the city where anything is possible</h1>
            <!-- Put this h1 in picture above - left downer corner or centered -->

            <h2>Berlin, the capital city of Germany, is renowned for its exceptional range of landmarks, vibrant
                cultural
                scene
                and way of life that's somehow all go yet relaxed.</h2>

            <P>In fact, the city is best known for its striking contrasts. Historical buildings stand alongside modern
                architecture as the past and present intermingle. The sights Berlin has to offer, from the Brandenburg
                Gate
                to the Chancellor's Office, bear witness to the history of an entire nation. Germany's capital is home
                to
                all
                the main government buildings, including the historical Reichstag building as the seat of the German
                parliament.
                Berlin is the city of art, artists and museums. In fact, precious artefacts from all over the world are
                showcased at more than 170 museums here, some of which can be found on the internationally renowned
                Museum
                Island.
                Berlin is a popular destination for classical music fans from every corner of the globe thanks to its
                leading
                orchestras, such as the globally popular Berlin Philharmonic, and the city's three huge opera houses,
                where spectacular operas and ballets are performed. And there is no end of theatre venues specialising
                in
                variety performances, revue, cabaret and more to ensure that there is something to keep everyone
                entertained.
                Shopaholics are in their element on the renowned Kurfürstendamm, on the elegant Friedrichstraße and in
                the
                independent boutiques around the Hackesche Höfe. Berlin is a trendsetting city when it comes to music,
                art
                and
                life itself.
                More and more artists are flocking to Berlin from all around the world to draw inspiration from the
                endless
                creative vibes, making it one of the most exciting destinations in the whole of Europe. The vibrant city
                is
                abuzz with
                change – Berlin simply cannot stay still for a moment. And yet the city somehow remains chilled, with
                plenty
                of
                open spaces where people can go to breathe in some fresh air. With sprawling parks, wooded areas and
                lakes,
                Berlin
                is Germany's greenest city. During the summer months, everyone moves outside. The sunshine and balmy
                evenings
                are best enjoyed in the beach bars, cafés and open-air cinemas and theatres, after all.</P>

            <h2>Nightlife districts in Berlin</h2>

            <p>While Berlin is exciting during the day, some districts only reveal their full beauty once the evening
                begins.
                When life plays out on the streets and the restaurants, bars and pubs begin to fill up.
                When Berliners and guests from all around the world meet up. When the evening never ends and night
                becomes
                day.
                Then you’ll experience a whole other side of the city and will truly have arrived in Berlin.</p>

            <p>Berlin loves techno – and that’s why it’s only in Berlin where you can realise how varied and
                electrifying
                this
                music can be. With Berghain and Watergate you have the choice between two of the best clubs
                in the world, guaranteed. You don’t have to worry about closing times, which is something quite contrary
                to
                other European cities. And even the public transport service has been designed with the lively
                party scene in mind: on the weekend most trains and buses will transport you to the most happening
                districts
                around the clock.
            </p>

            <p>There are no restraints placed on your party mood. Whether iconic Berlin, fashionable, alternative or
                vibrantly
                electronic: You’ll find the perfect way to spend the evening in each neighbourhood.</p>
